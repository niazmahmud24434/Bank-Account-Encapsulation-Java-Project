# Bank Account Encapsulation – Java Project

## Overview

This project demonstrates the concept of **encapsulation** in Java using a simple banking system. A `BankAccount` class is designed to protect sensitive account information by restricting direct access and allowing controlled interaction through public methods.

The project clearly shows how encapsulation helps maintain **data security, integrity, and reliability** in object-oriented programming.

---

## Project Description

The program includes:

* A `BankAccount` class with private data fields
* Public getter and setter methods for controlled access
* Validation logic to prevent invalid balance updates
* A main program that creates multiple account objects and displays their details

---

## Features

* Demonstrates **encapsulation** using private variables
* Controlled access through getters and setters
* Validation to reject negative balance values
* Multiple object creation for testing
* Beginner-friendly and well-structured code

---

## Class Structure

```
BankAccount
 ├─ accountNumber : String
 ├─ accountHolderName : String
 ├─ balance : double
 ├─ getAccountNumber()
 ├─ setAccountNumber()
 ├─ getAccountHolderName()
 ├─ setAccountHolderName()
 ├─ getBalance()
 └─ setBalance()
```

---

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Encapsulation-BankAccount-Project.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Compile the program:

```bash
javac Main.java
```

4. Run the program:

```bash
java Main
```

## UML Class Diagram

The UML diagram shows:

* A single `BankAccount` class
* Private attributes and public methods
* Clear representation of encapsulation

*(UML diagram image included in the repository)*

## Learning Outcome

Through this project, the following concepts are demonstrated:

* Encapsulation in Java
* Data hiding using access modifiers
* Controlled data access with getters and setters
* Input validation for maintaining data integrity
